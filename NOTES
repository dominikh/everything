* Adapters
  A lot of interesting data is external and does not offer SPARQL endpoints.
  Not all of that data can be imported into our triplestore, either.
  Either because it's too much data, or because it's highly dynamic.

  We'll need adapters that can translate between SPARQL and external APIs.
  This will need special considerations.
** Allow automatic use of adapters
   The user shouldn't need to write their queries around what data is internal vs what data is external.
** Allow JOINs between adapters, without absurd query costs
   A query like "find all artists born in all cities that currently have rain" is not feasible if we have to query multiple APIs.
   Such queries will probably need to include local information so that we can reduce the number of calls we need to make to APIs.
   This is related to the topic of query planning.
* Importing data
  Not all external data has to go through adapters.
  For example, when we index movies on the local file system, we can import the most important information (such as title, release year, actors, â€¦) into our triplestore.
  This will allow us to answer most queries without having to call out to APIs.
